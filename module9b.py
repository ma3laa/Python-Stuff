#Comparison operators

x = 10

#Prints False as it is not equal

print(x>y)

# x is NOT greater than y hence it printing False

## Logical operators

c = 12
print(c > 2 and c < 17)

#AND needs both to be True to return as true

c = 5
print(c > 3 or c < 4)

#OR requires only one of the variables to be true


a = 4
print(not(a > 2 and a < 7))

a = 4
print(not(a > 2 and a < 4))

#NOT just doing the opposite, use common sense + you know this already
