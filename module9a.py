#There are many different types of operators(that we will cover on this course):
#Arithmetic operators
#Assignment operators
#Comparison operators
#Logical operators
#Identity operators
#Membership operators
#Bitwise operators


#Addition

x = 24 + 88
print(x)

#Subtraction

y = 4
z = 8
yz = y - z
print(yz)

#Multiplication

a = 8
b = 3
c = a*b
print(c)

#Division

d = 20
e = 4
f = d/e
print(int(f))

#Expononent or Index/Indices

aaa = 3**3
print(aaa)

#arithmetic operator + assignment operator ( = )



g = 2
g += 5
print(g)

i = 72
i -= 39
print(i)

h = 10
h *= 3
print(h)

j = 89546
j /= 35
print(j)

#Assignment operators
#ADD AND ~ Multiply AND
